# Web-Script Programming
## Coursework Challenge 1 (ws_cwk1)

Welcome to the first coursework for the Web Script Programming unit.  This folder contains all the challenges that you must _try_ to complete.

This is an individual coursework, so whilst you are allowed to discuss both the challenges _and_ the approaches you might take to tackling them, everything you submit must be your own work.

## Scenario

The scenario is that we're building a web-based game and you're joining the development team.  The game is not finished, but you have been given a basic framework that is working.

To help you get up to speed with the framework we've stripped out a few bits of code and want you to add them back in so that everything works.  Once you've achieved this you'll be ready to start developing with the rest of the team.

* Unit tests are in the same format that you have completed every week.
* For this coursework:
  * Tests are all in a file called `test.js`.
  * Our game library is a file called `lib.js`.
  * *Your* code will all be added to `index.js` (i.e. you *MUST NOT* modify any file other than `index.js`).

* To run the unit tests you should open `index.html`.
* To see the framework for the game _without_ the unit test harness, open `game.html`.
* Different panels can be toggled on and off with the `D`, `L` and `P` keys.

Note that the output of the last test cannot be automatically checked, so you will need to manually ensure that you have completed what is requested.

## Submission / Upload
When you have completed all the tests to the best of your ability, upload your `index.js` file to the dropbox on Moodle.
